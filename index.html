    <h2>Card and Board Games</h2>
    <p>I am a huge fan of board and card games like The Settlers of Catan, A Game of Thrones and Legend of the Five Rings. I've been playing Magic: The Gathering since I was 10 years old, and played on the Professional Level from 2015 to 2017.</p>

    <h2>Live Action Roleplaying</h2>
    <p>One of my all time favorite hobbies is Live Action Roleplaying (LARP), where its somewhere between a tabletop game and a combat sport. I play Orcs and other maligned creatures in unique ways.</p>

    <h2>Mixed Martial Arts</h2>
    <p>Way back when, I competed in mixed martial arts competitions as an amateur, with a record of 5-2, and was active in <a href="www.IBJJF.com">IBJJF</a> competitions in and around the Springfield, MO area. </p>
